			<h1>About Me</h1>

		<div class="descrip">
			<p>
				I am currently in the middle of completing a full stack software
				engineering course through Codecademy. I was recently introduced to web
				development by husband who is a full stack engineer and enjoyed the
				challenge that coding gave me.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				I am a working of mom of two, and a house full of pets. I have a degree
				in Psychology and I am a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist. For the
				past almost decade, I provided therapy to indviduals, families, couples,
				and groups. I have taught various psychology courses to undergraduates
				and I have consulted with NYC schools on various mental health and
				social emotional topics. In all honesty, to be there for someone in an
				emotional and mental way can be very taxing and I no longer had the
				capacity to give as I once did. Software development has brought out
				another passion and I truly look forward to continuing my journey down
				this path.

				When I am not studying or coding, I am running after two beautiful girls
				who are the reasons I have found my voice and for who I get up everyday.
				I enjoy my daily dog walks, as we chase squirrels and my morning wake up
				meows from a hungry cat. I enjoy indoor cycling, creating things in the
				kitchen, wine, food, and hosting events. Also, I am a true fan of the
				snow and might be slightly addicted to coffee.
